> Workspace: `master` @ `4e037bb` plus unpublished storefront UI in the working tree.
> Status labels below distinguish **Implementation Complete**, **Visual QA Pending**, and **Production Verified**.

## Production / Release Blockers

These are **not claimed resolved** by this documentation pass:

1. Full-site visual QA not signed off.
2. Production env completeness (Razorpay live keys, Brevo SMTP, `ADMIN_2FA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `INVOICE_TOKEN_SECRET`, GA4/Pixel IDs) must be confirmed on the live host — not inferred from this workspace.
3. Admin Newsletter campaign system is absent if that is a launch requirement.
4. Admin Dark Mode is absent if that is a launch requirement.
5. Unpublished working-tree UI is not committed.

This workspace does **not** record a production-verified go-live.

---

## QA Requirements

Before calling the storefront production-ready:

- Walk Home, Shop, Product, Cart, Checkout, Account, About, Policy, Support in Light, Dark, and System.
- Confirm gold accents, circular icon wells, rectangular product CTAs, and pill `.btn` hierarchy.
- Confirm Dark Mode heading/link/scrollbar/outline contrast without changing Light Mode.
- Confirm Policy Hero eyebrow stays one line and About mobile Promise is 2×3.
- Place a Razorpay test/live payment, a COD order, and a Manual UPI verify/reject.
- Confirm order emails send once per type.
- Confirm newsletter pending → confirm flow in Brevo (automation is outside this repo).
- Confirm GA4 and Meta Pixel only fire when IDs are configured; run Events Manager diagnostics separately.

## Database Migrations

Canonical order remains `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` §1 (12 files). Fresh install: `database/schema.sql` + `database/seed.sql`. No new migration is required for the unpublished UI or this documentation refresh.

---

## Environment Variables (names only)

Documented in `SETUP.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`. Never paste real values.

Required for a working shop: `DB_*`, `SITE_URL`.

For live features: Razorpay keys, `ADMIN_2FA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, Brevo SMTP, `BREVO_API_KEY` (newsletter), `INVOICE_TOKEN_SECRET` (guest invoices), `GA4_*`, `META_PIXEL_ID`, `META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
